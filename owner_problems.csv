"1)Vet bills. ‘Gotta do it though. What limits the size of my pack is my ability to afford their medical care. No pet of mine is ever going to die because I didn't plan properly.
2) Other people asking you to take a stray, or the pet they now find it inconvenient to care for, and they often note that if you don't, they will have to take the poor animal to a kill shelter, where owner surrenders are often moved to the front of the line, the “euthanasia “ line. So now it's my fault….. Yeah, pretty screwed up logic.
3) Other pet owners who are idiots. Currently we have a neighbor with a growing pup.

3) Other pet owners who are idiots. Currently we have a neighbor with a growing pup. They let him run loose, and don't train or vet him. He's in our yard, growling at us, and they do nothing because they are idiots and claim they have no money. I have let them know of all the low cost and free options and have offered to teach them how to train, but they avail themselves of none of it. They keep asking me when the dog will learn stuff. I say when you teach it to him, and they giggle. Not funny. I don't need a crystal ball to see that dog’s future. He just may bite someone, maybe even me, and eventually he will be judged unmanageable and dangerous. He will be dumped at the kill shelter, where his fear, confusion, and natural protective instincts will also move him to the front of the to-be-killed line. He probably already has heartworm. All preventable. This isn't a new or unfamiliar story to me. It breaks my heart every time. It's especially heartbreaking to view it outside of my front window.
4) People who take their dogs in public , untrained and out of control, possibly unvaccinated as well. It's foolish and dangerous to all to let your dog near my dog, because you know nothing about us. My dog or yours might bite, or be sick. The dog flu is in our area too. I no longer walk mine where there's likely to be other dogs. Vaccines are not 100%.
5). People who approach my dogs without asking first. I may be in the middle of training, or have a new, unpredictable dog. I have one who just might bite. She's a former pet taken somehow to a puppy mill breeder, so her mistrust of people is quite justified. Nothing can erase such trauma. She will bite if she thinks you intend to take her or harm us. Just don't pet or approach any dogs without permission.
6) But, my number one pet peeve, piss me off, make me sick, drive me batshit crazy soapbox is people who do not properly care for and protect animals. They don't spay or neuter because of some bullshit about the miracle of life. Do they go experience the miracle of death? No! Our country kills millions of cats and dogs whose only crime for this death sentence is that they are unwanted. We spend our resources on kill programs but not on public education or subsidized spay/neuter programs. Many, many people, probably even you, turn a blind eye to these crimes against living, feeling creatures who are really not that different than us. I'm told it's too big a problem. What can little old me do? There are starving children in Africa/China, etc. So many excuses, when really it’s permission to look away, to pretend these cute little puppies aren't going to be gassed , or that those darling zoo animals are really happy when in fact it takes Prozac and Thorazine and other drugs to stop them from inflicting harm upon themselves because that's not what we took our human children to the zoo to see.
I warned you.
One we saved. We made all the difference for this one dog."

"My frequent problem may not be one that everyone has but I believe it's still relevant for a few reasons
Kids
Yes kids are my frequent problem when it comes to my dog. We are daily users of our local dog park which has a sign that lists all the rules one of which being that no kids under the age of 16 are allowed into the park.
But I've never seen anyone actually following this rule.
My dog is great in many ways, social with people, social with dogs, and in general she is pretty great, but her only flaw is that kids are not her thing. So when kids enter the DOG park we are forced to leave.

Not only is this an issue with dogs who have problems with kids but some parents think it's totally acceptable to bring their toddlers into the park and let them run and play. But those same parents get upset as soon as a dog knocks them over or steals their toys.
This is also the issue I have when goin basically anywhere with my dog. Now if you as a parent ask me first OR you tell your child to ask “hi can I pet your dog” then I'll be the most polite person you've ever met and I'll kindly explain that no sorry this puppy is a little grumpy.
Just please always ask first!

"There is one massive insurmountable problem that all dog owners face: the length of the life of a dog. It's the most horrible quirk of fate that the most wonderful animals many of us chose to spend our lives with live on average less than 1/6th of a human life. Which is long enough for them to go through a huge amount of changes with us, with them at our sides. Then they are gone and our hearts are broken. I've lost 5 dogs and each one of them has left a hole in my heart that will never be filled.

"I’ve been a dog owner for many years. Here are the biggest problems I’ve faced:
Vet bills. If a dog is sickly, it can get very expensive very fast. Get insurance if you can.
The dog’s life is too short. If you love your dog, then losing him or her can be devastating. I wrote about that here.
Some friends or relatives may be afraid of your dog. I had one close friend who never came over because I had dogs, and my dogs were very friendly. I finally got her to come over if I crated my dogs, which I did occasionally so I could see her.

Going away without the dogs. Sometimes it’s not practical to take a dog with you. It’s hard to find a dog sitter that you trust, and I also feel badly leaving a old or sick dog for a few days. Two or three week vacation? Forget about it.
A lost dog. This is every dog owner’s nightmare. I’m active in dog rescue, and most people don’t know that the single biggest factor in whether you will get your dog back or not is a microchip. Chip your dog. Period. There’s no excuse not to. There are lots of low-cost ways to do it.
I hope this helps."

My friend and I were walking her Fox Terrier in an off-lead park. It was quiet except for a larger dog about 10 metres away. We could tell he was young, but he was approaching my friend’s dog perfectly. He didn’t rush in, but kept his distance and lay on the ground, observing with a relaxed face and a wagging tail.

My friend said,”What are you apologising for?”
“I promise my dog won’t hurt your dog. He’s really lovely.”
“We never thought your dog would hurt my dog. What do you mean?”
The woman then went on to explain that her dog had once exhibited those behaviours at the dog park and a woman with a small dog had screamed at her to,”Stop your dog from stalking my dog!!!”.
Stalking??!!! We advised the young woman that that stupid idiot had no idea about dogs at all, and the way her young dog was approaching strange dogs was textbook impeccable and that he was exhibiting perfect dog etiquette. Both if us were vet nurses so we knew what we were talking about, and we told her that if anyone ever accused her dog of ‘stalking’ again, to explain what we’d said. We described to her what stalking looked like so she could explain that to ignorant morons who couldn’t differentiate.
Another annoying instance of doggy ignorance from those who should know better, was when a pet insurance company refused a claim for the sedation part of a Rottie’s medical treatment because they said that the sedation was only needed because the dog was aggressive. There was no history of aggressive behaviour. They just assumed that the dog was aggressive because of the breed. My boss (the vet) was LIVID and contacted the insurance company by phone and in writing to argue the refusal.
The Rottie was not aggressive at all. He had a huge moist pyoderma (bacterial infection) on his face that needed to be clipped and cleaned. The lovely doggy was fine with the vet poking and prodding him to assess the pyoderma. The reason we had to sedate him was because it’s painful procedure - the skin you are clipping is all infected and inflamed, and we needed him nice and still because we had to clip around his eyes and all his skinfolds on his face. We would have sedated any dog, regardless of breed or size, for that procedure, because it would have been cruel not to.
The vet pointed all this out and the insurance company paid out. Idiots."

"Stalking??!!! We advised the young woman that that stupid idiot had no idea about dogs at all, and the way her young dog was approaching strange dogs was textbook impeccable and that he was exhibiting perfect dog etiquette. Both if us were vet nurses so we knew what we were talking about, and we told her that if anyone ever accused her dog of ‘stalking’ again, to explain what we’d said. We described to her what stalking looked like so she could explain that to ignorant morons who couldn’t differentiate."

"Another annoying instance of doggy ignorance from those who should know better, was when a pet insurance company refused a claim for the sedation part of a Rottie’s medical treatment because they said that the sedation was only needed because the dog was aggressive. There was no history of aggressive behaviour. They just assumed that the dog was aggressive because of the breed. My boss (the vet) was LIVID and contacted the insurance company by phone and in writing to argue the refusal."

"The Rottie was not aggressive at all. He had a huge moist pyoderma (bacterial infection) on his face that needed to be clipped and cleaned. The lovely doggy was fine with the vet poking and prodding him to assess the pyoderma. The reason we had to sedate him was because it’s painful procedure - the skin you are clipping is all infected and inflamed, and we needed him nice and still because we had to clip around his eyes and all his skinfolds on his face. We would have sedated any dog, regardless of breed or size, for that procedure, because it would have been cruel not to."

"She destroyed her collar charger. Oddly enough, on accident.
“Why is that a huge problem?”
Because she’s reverting back to the crazy, hyper, overly vocal dog that I paid significant money to train away.
She barks at everyone (even recurring visitors) and it’s not perceived as a “friendly hello” bark, but more of a “WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE TRESPASSER?!” bark. Not good.
She refuses to listen to commands outside and bolts full tilt across the yard. God forbid if anyone or anything is near the yard when we get outside; she will not listen to commands when she’s so wound up. Thankfully the only person

She refuses to listen to commands outside and bolts full tilt across the yard. God forbid if anyone or anything is near the yard when we get outside; she will not listen to commands when she’s so wound up. Thankfully the only person she jumped on happened to love dogs. She only wants love and attention but she barks and jumps in a way that intimidates strangers.
The worst issue… she refuses to give up on mouthing. Touch her back? Mouth. Go to pet her head (anyone but me)? Mouth. Put your hand out at all? Mouth.
She doesn’t bite anyone but she runs and mouths which when you combine the two can still hurt. It’s the one habit that no matter how much I work with her, she refuses to fix.
Now I’m stuck waiting to see if I can get a replacement collar charger (the cord broke when she flopped down against the wall and ripped the cord out) or if I need to spend $100+ on a new one. At least then I can work with the other problems…"

"Well…I have a good experience to answer this.. :)
In 2017.. I had puppy at my place... We used to call it Siddhu.. It was hardly a one month baby :) those days.. God knows from where it came to my place and my super emotional mom started giving it dudh and chapati.. It was just a baby so we never thought of tying it by a chain or belt..
So it stayed at my place for 3 months..
Undoubtedly it was a super happy time for my entire family.. :)

Because every morning I used to leave my home at 7:45 for my college and to catch my college bus at sharp 8.
But.. He ( siddhu ) used to come with me to the bus stop no matter how much I refuse..
It was a main road and busy too.. Also there used to be many adult dogs to trouble him..
So the scared me, used to take him in my hands and again drop him back to my home at 8 :D
So.. ultimately I used to miss my bus everyday and get late.
And so it continued for the 3 months more..
Here is the picture of a cute trouble :D
PS : It was my favourite trouble I have ever had.. so never thought to find a solution :)
Thanks :)

Hagrid Malcolm Rex, aka Rex, aka “dummy”:
Tore out the electric outlets from the wall. We still don’t know how he didn’t get electrocuted by them.
He also chewed on the windshield wipers on my mom’s car. And the little letters that said the brand. And the brake wires.
He also tore out part of the wooden door’s frame (to this day, the frame is missing that chunk).
He ripped out the wires from the electric water pump that takes water up to the second floor. He did this three times. We put a wooden box over it. He removed the box (chewed on it, of course) and tore out the wires. We put a brick over the box to weigh it down. He removed the brick, removed the box, and tore out the wires. Seemed like nothing would stop him until we put a metal padlock on that thing. He stopped, only because I think that the metal didn’t taste too good.
He nibbled on the plaster walls (our guess is that he really needed some minerals?).
He ate a lot, but not satisfied with food, he also ate several plastic dishes, until we had to buy metal pots for him to drink and eat out of.
He absolutely obliterated several chew toys that were branded “unbreakable”, as well as every single lining and bedding that we gave him for his kennel (shaped like a large igloo… and he chewed on the edges as well).
He shredded countless letters, bills, and magazines; he’s the reason we even installed a mailbox at all.
He stole apples from the kitchen and would not let you in the house if you had tortillas and didn’t give him one.
He was housebroken, but when he needed to go, he didn’t mind pulling on the leash and basically treating us like a human kite.
He would chase after the neighborhood cats and every single bird he saw; he once caught one, and the poor thing died of shock.
And that was during his first two years with us. He lived to be eleven, and then he got bone cancer (like many in his breed do), and we were forced to take the tough choice and help him across the Rainbow Bridge.
And I miss that destructive, impossible dog every single day of my life."
"Let me tell you a story:
It begins with a 2-month old chocolate Labrador puppy that was given to me as a Christmas present, by a well-meaning aunt who didn’t think to ask my parents first.

I will guarantee you that their dogs suffer the concequences of the same problem, and as far as I’m concerned, that is a far more pressing matter.
These owners (no matter the flavour) create and sustain a huge population of non-social, fearful, unreliable and unhappy dogs. Which is the main cause of the high number of incidents that envolve dogs. Dog-dog incidents as well as dog-human incidents almost allways originate because a certain dog was nog properly socialized, trainend and/or guided.
Dog-dog incidents: The lack of proper socialization, training and guidence allows behaviours in dogs that trigger other dogs to respond fearful, alert or even agressive. If those provoked dogs in their turn have not been properly socialized, trainend and/or guided either, incidents occur. Even if the provoked dog WAS properly guided these incidents may happen simply because the first dog has no clue how to act properly around other dogs and may attack out of habit, fear or dominance.
Dog-Human incidents: The lack of proper socialization, training and guidence allows fear and insecurity to dictate an instinctual response of dogs towards (unfamiliar) humans in situations that are uncomfortable to them. Abuse, wrongly timed corrections, oppression and invasive behaviour causes a lack of trust in the dog towards people or even their owner, creating dangerous situations.
I am confronted with stressed out, non-social, fearfull and out of line dogs so often that I have changed the locations and times of day I walk my dog to avoid them. I own a Rottweiler female who is very friendly and inquisitive by nature. We have had so many near accidents that I was affraid that her happy and friendly demeanor would fade away. So I have taken steps to prevent trouble. But let’s be honest, that doesn’t solve anything. So if you really want to help dogs, deal with the owners! Educate them on dog language, train them how to teach dogs and push proper dog-etiquette down their throats! Most behavioural issues will melt away automatically once owners become aware of what their dogs are communicating to them and most importantly: once owners start to take that communication seriously and act properly upon it. Respect a dogs preferences and boundaries. Teach them how to make te choices you want them to make, instead of bullying them into submission, protect them from people, dogs and other things they do not like and stop letting children treat dogs as living toys.
That would help me and my dog most. And theirs as well."

"These owners (no matter the flavour) create and sustain a huge population of non-social, fearful, unreliable and unhappy dogs. Which is the main cause of the high number of incidents that envolve dogs. Dog-dog incidents as well as dog-human incidents almost allways originate because a certain dog was nog properly socialized, trainend and/or guided."

"Dog-dog incidents: The lack of proper socialization, training and guidence allows behaviours in dogs that trigger other dogs to respond fearful, alert or even agressive. If those provoked dogs in their turn have not been properly socialized, trainend and/or guided either, incidents occur. Even if the provoked dog WAS properly guided these incidents may happen simply because the first dog has no clue how to act properly around other dogs and may attack out of habit, fear or dominance."

"Dog-Human incidents: The lack of proper socialization, training and guidence allows fear and insecurity to dictate an instinctual response of dogs towards (unfamiliar) humans in situations that are uncomfortable to them. Abuse, wrongly timed corrections, oppression and invasive behaviour causes a lack of trust in the dog towards people or even their owner, creating dangerous situations."

"I am confronted with stressed out, non-social, fearfull and out of line dogs so often that I have changed the locations and times of day I walk my dog to avoid them. I own a Rottweiler female who is very friendly and inquisitive by nature. We have had so many near accidents that I was affraid that her happy and friendly demeanor would fade away. So I have taken steps to prevent trouble. But let’s be honest, that doesn’t solve anything. So if you really want to help dogs, deal with the owners! Educate them on dog language, train them how to teach dogs and push proper dog-etiquette down their throats! Most behavioural issues will melt away automatically once owners become aware of what their dogs are communicating to them and most importantly: once owners start to take that communication seriously and act properly upon it. Respect a dogs preferences and boundaries. Teach them how to make te choices you want them to make, instead of bullying them into submission, protect them from people, dogs and other things they do not like and stop letting children treat dogs as living toys."
